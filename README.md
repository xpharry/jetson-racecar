# Jetson RacecarX

An Autonomous Driving Car based on MIT-RaceCar using Jetson-TX2.

The goal of this work till now as **the 1st stage** is to replicate the work in MIT's Autonomous Driving class, including

- Hardware Building
- Software Installation
- ROS Teleoperation
- Hokuyo 2D Lidar SLAM
- TBD

After this, I would like to go further and check the great potential of the platform for other research.

Shout out to Jestonhacks, my initial work till now has benefitted from his [**website**](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/racecar-j/) and [**github**](https://github.com/RacecarJ) which has been a bridge with MIT Racecar. Also thank [**MIT RACECAR**](https://mit-racecar.github.io/) for providing such a powerful platform for learning and research.

## Hardware Assembly

Apparently, there is always a budget issue when it comes to the hardware and sensors. In fact, this has been the highest cost project of myself. I was simply following the official tutorials which saves me time to try and error. For me, if this platform is not for a long term use then it is a great waste.

For those who are interested, I would recommend some other substitutes for sensors like camera and lidar which cost much lower but offer enough performance.

  I am using a Hokuyo UTM-30LX 2D Lidar as I happened to find a second-hand one which could be even cheaper and apparently more powerful than a Hokuyo UST-10LX. But I also I have given the price on mounting it. I didn't expect that the size of UTM-30LX is bigger than UST-10LX and I had to spend hours to cut the square hole to fit the size.

  As in the article, the Lidar requires an exclusive cable for powering. Some soldering work needs to be done to make a splitter power output from the power bank. The Lidar will share power input with the Jetson TX2.

  Differing with UST-10LX, UTM-30LX uses an USB cable for data transferring which saves our effort to set up network as in the article.

## Experiments
